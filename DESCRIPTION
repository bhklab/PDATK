Description: A unique set of 89 pancreatic cancer samples profiled using both 
  sequencing and microarray platform was used for training the PCOSP 
  (Pancreatic cancer overall survival predictor) to predict patients with 
  early death (within >1 yr) after surgery. Further, to validate the model we 
  used genomicprofiles of 823 samples curated from public domain. The 
  simplistic k-top scoring pair approach was used to build the model, where we 
  looked at relative expression of gene pairs within the patient. Add
  description of CDAC and rePURIST.
