\title{Predict optimal K values by minimizing the difference between the ECDF
  of clustering consensus at two points in a subinterval.}
\usage{
optimalKMinimizeAmbiguity(assayClusters, subinterval = c(0.1, 0.9))
}
\arguments{
\item{assayClusters}{A `SimpleList` of clustering results from a 
`ConsensusMetaclusteringModel`, as returned by `models(object)` where
object is a trained `ConsensusMetaclusteringModel` object.}

\item{subinterval}{A `numeric` vector of two float values, the first
being the lower and second being the upper limit of the subinteral
to compare cluster ambiguity over. Default is c(0.1, 0.9), i.e. comparing
the 10th and 90th percentile of cluster consensus to calculate the 
ambiguity of a given clustering solution. This is the value used to
selected the optimal K value from the potential solutions for each
assay in the training data.}
}
\value{
A `numeric` vector the same length as `assayClusters`, with 
  an optimal K prediction for each assay in the `rawdata` slot of 
  the trained `ConsensusMetaclusteringModel` object which `assayClusters`
  came from.
}
