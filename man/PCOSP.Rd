\usage{
PCOSP(trainCohort, minDaysSurvived = 365, ..., randomSeed)
}
\arguments{
\item{minDaysSurvived}{An \code{integer} indicating the minimum number of day
required to be in the 'high' survival group. Any patients below this
cut-off will be considered low survival. Default is 365 days.}

\item{...}{Force subsequent parameters to be named. This parameter is not
used.}

\item{randomSeed}{An \code{integer} random seed to use for training the model. If
missing, this defaults to the seed 1234.}

\item{trainCohorts}{A \code{SurvivalExperiment}s for training
the PCOSP model, with}
}
\value{
A \code{PCOSP} object with training data in the assays slot, concatenating
together the molecular data types and labelling the genes with the data
type to ensure the results are easily interpretable.
